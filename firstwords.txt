Hey what's up, I'm Kevin.

I'm typing up some stuff here as a way of controlling my thoughts about going through freeCodeCamp's ginormous list. 

Right now I'm tasked to make a simple portfolio website on copepen.io. I looked at their example and played with somethings and immediately thought "There's no way they're not using JS with this." So I checked, and I was right. It's not a problem, but why tell us to do something that's functionally similar when it has some properties that we haven't even gone over yet?

Either way, I'll do it. I just don't have anything to shower for in the assumed projects section. Oh well.

I'll have a running blog system later this month that comes from following the free mini bootcamp over at Lambda School.
